# Silvanus
Silvanus is the ultimate Grow A Tree companion bot! Quickly compare your server's tree to others on the leaderboard with automatic calculation of tree height differences, active growth detection, watering time calculations, and more! Get started with `/help` and `/setup`, then check out `/compare`.

Important Note: Silvanus is only as up-to-date as your server's Tree and Tallest Trees messages. Make sure to refresh them before refreshing Silvanus' Compare message.

For the best experience we recommend the use of a single /tree and /top trees message, otherwise make sure to run /setup each time you run `/compare`.

Silvanus is not affiliated with Grow A Tree or Limbo Labs.

## Setup
To begin analyzing your Tree, first you must set up the reference messages.
1. Run `/setup` in the channel(s) that contain your server's tree and leaderboard messages.
2. Now simply run `/compare` where you want your analysis to be visible.

## Permissions
Silvanus requires permissions to `Send Messages` and `Send Messages in Threads` if applicable.

## Commands
* `/setup` - You only need to run this command if your server has its `/tree` and `/top trees` messages in separate channels.
* `/setupinfo` - Displays links to the current Tree and Tallest Trees messages configured in your server.
* `/compare` - Sends a refreshable embed that calculcates the height difference between your tree and the trees currently displayed on your Tallest Trees message. There is also an Active Growth Indicator (`[ðŸ’§]`).
* `/setping` - Guild members with the `Manage Roles` permission can run this command to set up automatic reminders when your tree is ready to be watered.
    * Type a reminder message (including any `@pings` desired) and select a channel to send the reminders in.
    * Once this command has been run a new `Reset Ping` button will appear next time you refresh the `/compare` message.
    * Click the `Reset Ping` button to be sent a reminder the next time the tree is ready to be watered.
    * Use `/optout` to disable reminder messages for your server.
* `/watertime` - Calculates the wait time between waters for a tree of a given height.
* `/timetoheight` - Calculates how long it would take to go from `beginheight` to `endheight`.
* `/reset` - Removes your server's configuration from the database.
* `/help` - Displays the bot's help page and links to each command.
