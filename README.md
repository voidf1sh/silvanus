# Silvanus
Silvanus is the ultimate Grow A Tree companion bot! Quickly compare your server's tree to others on the leaderboard with automatic calculation of tree height differences, active growth detection, watering time calculations, and more!

Important Note: Silvanus is only as up-to-date as your server's newest Tree and Tallest Trees messages. Make sure to refresh them before refreshing Silvanus' Compare message.

Silvanus is not affiliated with Grow A Tree or Limbo Labs.

## Setup

If your `/tree` and `/top trees` messages are in the same channel, simple run `/compare` in that channel and you're good to go!

Otherwise, run `/setup` to set the proper channels for the bot to look in for the `/tree` and `/top trees` messages.

Use `/commands` to view a description of all my commands.
