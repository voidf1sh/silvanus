Quickly compare your server's tree to others on the leaderboard with automatic calculation of tree height differences, active growth detection, watering time calculations, and more! Get started with </help:1065346941166297129> and </setup:1065407649363005561>, then check out </compare:1065346941166297128>.\n\nImportant Note: Silvanus is only as up-to-date as your server's Tree and Tallest Trees messages. Make sure to refresh them before refreshing Silvanus' Compare message.\n\nFor the best experience we recommend the use of a single </tree:972648557796524032> and </top trees:1051840665362894950> message, otherwise make sure to run </setup:1065407649363005561> each time you run </compare:1065346941166297128>.\nStatus Indicator: ``[ Active Growth Indicator: üíß | 24 Hour Observed Growth | Wait Time Between Waters ]``",
