		"info": "This bot will analyze your tree (from the Grow A Tree Bot by Limbo Labs) and compare its growth to other trees displayed on the leaderboard.\n\nThis bot assumes that there is a single </tree:972648557796524032> message and a single </top trees:1051840665362894950> message that everyone uses. If everyone creates their own </tree:972648557796524032> and </top trees:1051840665362894950>,  be sure to run </setup:1065407649363005561> before </comapare:1065346941166297128>.

		"setup": "To begin analyzing your Tree, first you must set up the reference messages.\n\n1. Run </setup:1065407649363005561> in the channel(s) that contain your server's tree and leaderboard messages.\n2. Now simply run </compare:1065346941166297128> where you want your analysis to be visible.",
		"permissions": "At a minimum, Silvanus requires permissions to `Send Messages` and `Send Messages in Threads` if applicable. If Analyzer is given permission to `Manage Messages`, the bot will delete the `.settree` and `.setranks` messages to reduce spam."
